# Skinalyze 
Skinalyze is a web-based platform that analyzes user inputs and provides tailored skincare product recommendations. It bridges the gap between personalized skincare advice and easy access to suitable products, empowering users to make informed decisions for their skincare routines.

## **Features**
1. **User Authentication**
   - Secure signup and login with JWT-based authentication.
   - Authorization using Bearer tokens.

2. **User Profiles**
   - Create profiles with skin type, concerns, and budget.
   - Each profile is associated with a specific user.

3. **Recommendations**
   - Fetch recommendations based on the user profile.
   - Recommendations are filtered using a comprehensive dataset.

4. **Storage**
   - Profiles and recommendations are stored in MongoDB for easy access and retrieval.

## **System Workflow**
1. **User Signup**
   - Users create an account with their name, email, and password.
   - A unique `userId` is embedded in the JWT token upon signup.

2. **User Login**
   - Users log in with their credentials.
   - Authenticated users receive a token for secure access.

3. **Profile Creation**
   - Users create a profile containing skin type, concerns, and budget.
   - The profile is linked to the userâ€™s `userId`.

4. **Recommendations Generation**
   - The system fetches the user's latest profile from MongoDB.
   - Matches the data to provide relevant product recommendations.

5. **Recommendations Storage**
   - Generated recommendations are stored in MongoDB for future reference.
